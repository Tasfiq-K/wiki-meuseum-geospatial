# [List of most-visited museums with Geo-maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-visited_museums)

Just a starter notebook that does some basic geo data analysis with the most visited museums.

Used `pandas` to get the data from wikipedia and further processing. `Nominatim` from `geopy` was utilized to get detailed **location**, **latitude**, **longitude** values.

At last, `folium` was used to show the museum location in map.
